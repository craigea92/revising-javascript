/*
DECLARING VARIABLES WITH "LET"

In JavaScript the let keyword is used to create new variables. 
We've already written some strings directly in console.log statements, so now lets practice using them as variables.

let name = 'John'
console.log(name)
// prints: John
*/

// Assignment
// Declare a new variable called email and set it to the string johndoe@gmail.com.

// Solution
let email = 'johndoe@gmail.com'
console.log(email)
