LOGGING TO THE CONSOLE IN JS

LET'S BUILD THE BACK-END OF A MOVIE REVIEW APP
For the next few chapters we'll create the building blocks of a back-end web server. 
The purpose of the server will be to supply up-to date information about the state of our Movie review mobile app: "MovieStarz". 
For example, the server will:

Store user information (emails, names, passwords)
Provide authentication mechanisms
Store movie reviews
Recommend movies based on choices
Etc.

PRINTING TO THE CONSOLE IN JAVASCRIPT
In Python, we used print() to print text. In JavaScript, we use console.log(), and we typically denote strings using single quotes:

console.log('this text will be printed')
*/

// Assignment
// Print Starting MovieStarz server to the console.

// Solution
console.log("Starting MovieStarz server");
