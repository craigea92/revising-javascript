/**
LINE ENDINGS WITH SEMI-COLONS

In languages like C, C++, and Java, a semicolon is used as a terminator in various statements. 

For example, in JavaScript:
console.log('hello world');

Notice the ; at the end of the line. In JavaScript, semicolons are optional as a terminating character. 
Deciding whether or not to use them is up to you or the team you're working on.
