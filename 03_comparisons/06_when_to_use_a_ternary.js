WHEN TO USE A TERNARY

You will use if/else statements more often than ternaries, generally speaking.

Ternary operations are great for small, single-line conditionals. 

I've seen developers in the professional world get "clever" with ternaries, and start creating nested monstrosities like this:

const vehicleName = isTruck ? 'truck' : isCar ? 'car' : isScooter ? 'scooter' : 'vehicle';
