/*
MODIFYING CONST ARRAYS

It's important to note that const arrays can still be modified, they just can't be reassigned. 
That means we can add and remove elements, but we can't set a new array value with the assignment operator: =.

const drinks = []

// this works
drinks.push('lemonade')

// this breaks
drinks = ['root beer']
